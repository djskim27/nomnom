## App Overview

One of the most difficult decisions you can make in your life is choosing where to eat. Enter 'Nom Nom,' an application that finds restaurants near you based on your search parameters. Nom Nom is for the indecisive hungry person within all of us that literally cannot figure out where they should go to have their next meal because they aren't "craving anything specific" or is simply "down to go anywhere." This app lets you sort through nearby eateries, and gives you more information and options once you make a decision. Users are able to save restaurants to their favorite list after creating an account. So what are you waiting for? Your next meal is much closer than you think.
